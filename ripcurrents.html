		<div id="ripcon1">
			<p>
				Rip currents are fast flowing currents of water returning back to deeper water. Water brought to the shore by waves has to go back.
				In some places, these channels(sort of rivers) of water flow faster then Olympic swimmers. 
			</p>

			
			<h2 id="q2">What to do if you get caught caught in one?</h2>

			<p>
				Best is not get caught in a rip. If you are caught in one, don't try to swim against the rip. Stay calm and swim parrallel to the beach
				and once you get of the channel, catch a wave and try to get back to the shore with the wave.
			</p>

				Do not get into open water if you don't know how to swim or know anything about rip currents.
